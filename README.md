# Potential Unintended Consequences of Upstream Dam Removal on an Estuarine Reserve

This senior seminar project for Environmental Studies studies focuses on the impacts water quality and suspended sediment (SSC) loads have on submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). The study are of this project is the Otter Point Creek (OTP), a National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERSs) protected area in Maryland, USA. This work hopes to better inform the potential impact of dam removal projects planned upstream to the OTP site.
