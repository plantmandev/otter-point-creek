Method,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Snorkel from shore point of transect to established edge of bed point in a straight line perpendicular to the shoreline. Measure the distance from the channelward edge of bed to the shoreline and equally distribute 10 plots.,,,,,,,,
"Place 1/4 meter square quadrat to the right of transect line and, snorkeling, estimate the percent cover of each species present.",,,,,,,,
"Include presence and % cover of sessile macroalgea, do not note drifting macroalgae.",,,,,,,,
Measure the longest leaf length of approximately 90% of shoots (do not choose extreme outliers).,,,,,,,,
"Note presence of reproductive structures, epiphyte loading levels, water depth and sediment type.",,,,,,,,
Sampling should be conducted at least 1ce annually at the max biomass for the dominant species (probably July/Aug/Sept).,,,,,,,,
Collect biomass core using the 'ponytail' method 1 meter from permanent plot 5 at the mid point of the transect,,,,,,,,
Determine channelward edge of bed location and note coordinates as accurately as possible. Perhaps also note distance from shoreline benchmark.,,,,,,,,
